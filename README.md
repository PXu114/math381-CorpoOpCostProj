# math381-CorpoOpCostProj

- `FinalDraft.pdf` is my project report. You will find the written introduction, model, solution, analysis, and possible future directions there.
- `ProjectDraft.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that contains my final implementation for the project. The code itself is included in `FinalDraft.pdf` but you can run the code in this Jupyter Notebook.
- This project uses PySCIPOpt Python library to implement a linear optimization algorithm for solving a Traveling Salesman Problem, under the real life scenario of roadshow promotion. For more details, please check out the  document named `FinalDraft.pdf`.
- Please note that the most important aspect of this project is the modeling, not the coding. Also, please be aware that I made this course project before I received any systematic Python Programming training.
